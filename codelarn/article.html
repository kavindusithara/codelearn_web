        <p class="p">
          Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin
          to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing. HTML is the
          language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create
          pages and make them functional. The code used to make them visually
          appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later
          tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather
          than design.

        <h2 class="h">The History of HTML</h2>

        <p class="p">
          HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others
          starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Hypertext
          means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump
          to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The
          latest version is known as HTML5.A Markup Language is a way that
          computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and
          presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
